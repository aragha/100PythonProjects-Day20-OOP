Object Oriented Programming implementation of the Snake game project

* Goal: Create the classic snake game, using Python

* We'll be using Turtle graphics project ( https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html ) and OOP.

* The approach is to break down a complex problem into simple steps. The steps:
1. Create a snake body
2. Move the snake
3. Detect collision with food
4. Create a score board
5. Detect collision with walls
6. Detect collision with its tail

* Do this using user defined classes, attributes, and methods
