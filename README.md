# 100PythonProjects-Day20-OOP
Object Oriented Programming implementation of the Snake game project

Goal: Create the classic snake game, using Python

We'll be using Turtle graphics project ( https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html ) and OOP
The approach is to break down a complex problem into simple steps. The steps:
Create a snake body
Move the snake
Detect collision with food
Create a score board
Detect collision with walls
Detect collision with it's tail

Do this using user defined classes, attributes, and methods
